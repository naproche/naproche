# Domain Theory

An **experimental** formalization of basic topics from domain theory using
[sTeX](https://github.com/slatex/sTeX/blob/main/doc/stex-doc.pdf) to handle
mathematical structures in $\LaTeX$.


## Compiling the $\TeX$ Sources to PDF

To compile a single $\TeX$ file `<filename>.ftl.tex` in the `source` directory to
PDF, run `make <filename>` from within the `lib` directory. To compile all files
at once, run `make all` from within the `lib` directory.
