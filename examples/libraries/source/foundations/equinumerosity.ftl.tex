  \section*{Equinumerosity}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}\printlabel{FOUNDATIONS_13_4578620297183232}
      Let $A, B$ be classes.
      $A$ is equinumerous to $B$ iff there exists a bijection between $A$ and $B$.
    \end{definition}
  \end{forthel}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{proposition}\printlabel{FOUNDATIONS_13_3703161885818880}
      Let $A$ be a class.
      Then $A$ is equinumerous to $A$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      $\id_{A}$ is a bijection between $A$ and $A$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{proposition}\printlabel{FOUNDATIONS_13_8050301789536256}
      Let $A, B$ be classes.
      If $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous then $B$ and $A$ are equinumerous.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume that $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous.
      Take a bijection $f$ between $A$ and $B$.
      Then $f^{-1}$ is a bijection between $B$ and $A$.
      Hence $B$ and $A$ are equinumerous.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{proposition}\printlabel{FOUNDATIONS_13_3609912414306304}
      Let $A, B, C$ be classes.
      If $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous and $B$ and $C$ are equinumerous then $A$ and $C$ are equinumerous.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume that $A$ and $B$ are equinumerous and $B$ and $C$ are equinumerous.
      Take a bijection $f$ between $A$ and $B$ and a bijection $g$ between $B$ and $C$.
      Then $g \circ f$ is a bijection between $A$ and $C$.
      Hence $A$ and $C$ are equinumerous.
    \end{proof}
