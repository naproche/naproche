  \section*{Cardinal Numbers}

  \begin{definition}[forthel,id=SET_THEORY_06_8286266038681600,printid]
    Let $x$ be a set.
    The cardinality of $x$ is the ordinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa$ is equinumerous to $x$ and every ordinal that is equinumerous to $x$ is greater than or equal to $\kappa$.

    Let $|x|$ stand for the cardinality of $x$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[forthel,id=SET_THEORY_06_6818986081648640,printid]
    A cardinal number is an ordinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa = |x|$ for some
    set $x$.

    Let a cardinal stand for a cardinal number.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{proposition}[forthel,id=SET_THEORY_06_2820082336006144,printid]
    Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal.
    Then $|\kappa| = \kappa$.
  \end{proposition}
  \begin{proof}[forthel]
    $\kappa$ is an ordinal that is equinumerous to $\kappa$.
    Hence $|\kappa| \leq \kappa$.
    Consider a set $x$ such that $\kappa = |x|$.
    Then $|\kappa|$ is an ordinal that is equinumerous to $x$.
    Hence $\kappa \leq |\kappa|$.
    Thus $|\kappa| = \kappa$.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{proposition}[forthel,id=SET_THEORY_06_6920913721229312,printid]
    Let $x, y$ be sets.
    Then $x$ and $y$ are equinumerous iff $|x| = |y|$.
  \end{proposition}
  \begin{proof}[forthel]
    Case $x$ and $y$ are equinumerous.
      Take a bijection $f$ between $x$ and $y$.
      Consider a bijection $g$ between $y$ and $|y|$.
      Then $g \circ f$ is a bijection between $x$ and $|y|$ (by \printref{FOUNDATIONS_08_6435206693126144}).
      Hence $x$ and $|y|$ are equinumerous.
      Thus $|y| \geq |x|$.

      $f^{-1}$ is a bijection between $y$ and $x$.
      Consider a bijection $h$ between $x$ and $|x|$.
      Then $h \circ f^{-1}$ is a bijection between $y$ and $|x|$ (by \printref{FOUNDATIONS_08_6435206693126144}).
      Hence $y$ and $|x|$ are equinumerous.
      Thus $|x| \geq |y|$.

      Therefore $|x| = |y|$.
    End.

    Case $|x| = |y|$.
      Consider a bijection $f$ between $x$ and $|x|$ and a bijection $g$
      between $|y|$ and $y$.
      Then $g \circ f$ is a bijection between $x$ and $y$.
      Hence $x$ and $y$ are equinumerous.
    End.
  \end{proof}
