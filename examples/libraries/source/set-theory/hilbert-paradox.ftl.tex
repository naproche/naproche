  \begin{theorem*}[forthel,title=Hilbert's Paradox,id=hilbert_paradox]
    There exists no system of sets that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}[forthel]
    Assume the contrary.
    Consider a system of sets $S$ that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
    We have $S \subseteq S$.
    Hence $\bigcup S \in S$.
    Thus $\pow(\bigcup S) \in S$.
    Contradiction.
