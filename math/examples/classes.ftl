Lemma. 
    Let f be a function.
    Let x be an element of Dom f.

Definition.

Definition.
    A family is a set F such that every element of F is a set.

Definition.

Definition.
    Let B, C be classes.
    The intersection of B and C is { x in B | x << C}.
Let B /\ C stand for the intersection of B and C.

Definition.
    Let B, C be classes.
    The set difference of B and C is { x in B | x !<< C}.
Let B -- C stand for the set difference of B and C.

Axiom PairDefiningProperty.
      Let u, v, x, y be objects.
      If (x, y) = (u, v)
      then x = u and y = v.

Definition.
    Let F be a map.
    Let B, C be classes.
    F : B -> C iff Dom F = B and
    F(x) is an element of C for all elements x of B.

Let g retracts f stand for g(f(x)) = x for all elements x of Dom f.
Let h sections f stand for f(h(y)) = y for all elements y of Dom h.
    
Definition.
    Let F be a map.
    Let B, C be classes.
    F : B <-> C iff F : B -> C and there exists a map G such that
    G : C -> B  and
    G retracts F and G sections F.

Definition.
    Let B, C be sets.
    B is equinumerous with C iff there exists a map F such that
    F : B <-> C.

Lemma.
    Let B, C be sets.
    Assume that B is equinumerous with C.
    Then C is equinumerous with B.

Lemma.
    Let A, B, C be sets.
    Assume A is equinumerous with B.
    Assume B is equinumerous with C.
    Then A is equinumerous with C.
Proof.
    Take a map F such that F : A <-> B.
    Take a map G such that G : B -> A  and (for all elements x of A we have G(F(x)) = x) and
    (for all elements y of B we have F(G(y))=y).
    Take a map H such that H : B <-> C.
    Take a map I such that I : C -> B and (for all elements x of B we have I(H(x)) = x) and
    (for all elements y of C we have H(I(y))=y).
    For every element x of A H(F(x)) is an object.
    Define J(x) = H(F(x)) for x in A.
    For every element y of C G(I(y)) is an object.
    Define K(y) = G(I(y)) for y in C.
    K: C -> A.
    K retracts J and K sections J.
    J: A <-> C.
End.
