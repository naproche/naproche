\section{Macros}

This is a collection of commonly used synonyms for notions hard-coded into
\Naproche. It is intended to be imported to other ForTheL files to provide
these synonyms for them, rather that being considered as a stand-alone file.

\subsection{Equality}

\begin{forthel}
  Let $x$ and $y$ agree stand for $x = y$.

  Let $x$ agrees with $y$ stand for $x = y$.

  Let $x$ and $y$ are distinct stand for $x \neq y$.
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Elementhood Relation}

\begin{forthel}
  Let a member of $X$ stand for an element of $X$.

  Let $x$ belongs to $X$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.

  Let $X$ contains $x$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.

  Let $x$ is contained in $X$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.

  Let $x$ lies in $X$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.

  Let $x$ is in $X$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Domain}

\begin{forthel}
  Let the domain of $f$ stand for $\dom(f)$.

  Let $f$ is defined on $X$ stand for $\dom(f) = X$.
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Map Application}

\begin{forthel}
  Let the value of $f$ at $x$ stand for $f(x)$.

  Let $f(x,y)$ stand for $f((x,y))$.
\end{forthel}
