### Complex and Real Numbers

Signature. A complex number is an object.
Let z,w denote complex numbers.

Definition. CC is the collection of all complex numbers.

Axiom. CC is a set.

Signature.
A real number is a complex number.
Let x, y denote real numbers.

Signature. |z| is a real number.

Signature. x is positive is an atom.
Let eps, delta denote positive real numbers.

Signature. x < y is an atom.
Let x > y stand for y < x.
Let x =< y stand for x = y or x < y.

Axiom. x < y => not y < x.

Signature. Ball(eps,z) is a subset of CC that contains z.

Axiom. |z| < |w| for some element w of Ball(eps,z).

Definition. Let M be a subset of CC. M is open iff for every element z of M 
there exists eps such that Ball(eps,z) is a subset of M.

Axiom. Ball(eps,z) is open.

Signature.
A region is an open subset of CC.

Signature. Let M be a region. M is simply connected is an atom.

### Holomorphic Functions

Let f denote a function. Let M denote a class.

Definition. Let U be a subset of the domain of f. f is constant on U iff 
there exists an object z such that f(w) = z for every element w of U.
Let f is constant stand for f is constant on the domain of f.

Signature. A holomorphic function is a function f such that 
Dom(f) \subseteq CC and f(w) \in CC for every element w of Dom(f).

Let f denote a holomorphic function.

Definition. A local maximal point of f is an element z of the domain of f such that there 
exists eps such that Ball(eps,z) is a subset of the domain of f and 
|f(w)|=< |f(z)| for every element w of Ball(eps,z).

Axiom Open_Mapping_Theorem. Assume f is a holomorphic function and Ball(eps,z) is a subset of the domain of f. 
If f is not constant on Ball(eps,z) then f[Ball(eps,z)] is open.

Axiom Identity_Theorem.
Assume f is a holomorphic function and the domain of f is a simply connected region. 
Assume that Ball(eps,z) is a subset of the domain of f. 
If f is constant on Ball(eps,z) then f is constant.

Theorem Maximum_principle.
Assume f is a holomorphic function and the domain of f is a simply connected region. 
If f has a local maximal point then f is constant.
Proof.
Let z be a local maximal point of f. Take eps such that 
Ball(eps,z) is a subset of Dom(f) and |f(w)| =< |f(z)| for every element w of Ball(eps,z).
Let us show that f is constant on Ball(eps,z).
  proof by contradiction.
  Assume the contrary. Then f[Ball(eps,z)] is open. We can take delta such that 
Ball(delta, f(z)) is a subset of f[Ball(eps,z)].
  Therefore there exists an element w of Ball(eps,z) such that |f(w)| > |f(z)|. Contradiction.
  end.
Hence f is constant.
