In this document we give a proof of Cantor's Theorem:

\begin{theorem*}
  There is no surjection from a set onto its powerset.
\end{theorem*}

Some basic notions and set-theoretic axioms used to formulate and prove it are
taken from:

\begin{forthel}
  [read \path{examples/preliminaries.ftl.tex}]
\end{forthel}

Moreover, we need to provide certain definitions concerning surjective
functions and the notion of powerset.

\begin{forthel}
  \begin{definition*}
    Let $X$ be a set.
    A function of $X$ is a function $f$ such that $\dom(f) = X$.
  \end{definition*}

  \begin{definition*}
    Let $f$ be a function and $Y$ be a set.
    $f$ surjects onto $Y$ iff $Y = \class{f(x) | x \in \dom(f)}$.
  \end{definition*}

  Let a surjective function from $X$ to $Y$ stand for a function of $X$ that
  surjects onto $Y$.
  \begin{definition*}
    Let $X$ be a set.
    The powerset of $X$ is the collection of subsets of $X$.
  \end{definition*}
  
  \begin{axiom*}
    The powerset of any set is a set.
  \end{axiom*}
\end{forthel}

On this basis Cantor's theorem and its proof can be formalized as follows.

\begin{forthel}
  \begin{theorem*}[title=Cantor]
    Let $M$ be a set.
    No function of $M$ surjects onto the powerset of $M$.
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume the contrary.
    Take a surjective function $f$ from $M$ to the powerset of $M$.
    The value of $f$ at any element of $M$ is a set.
    Define \[ N = \class{x \in M | x \text{ is not an element of } f(x)}. \]
    $N$ is a subset of $M$.
    Consider an element $z$ of $M$ such that $f(z) = N$.
    Then \[ z \in N \iff z \notin f(z) = N. \]
    Contradiction.
  \end{proof}
\end{forthel}
