\begin{theorem}[forthel,title=Hilbert's Paradox,id=hilbert_paradox]
  There exists no system of sets that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[forthel]
  Assume the contrary.
  Consider a system of sets $S$ that is closed under powersets and closed under unions.
  We have $S \SETinclude S$.
  Hence $\SETunionover S \in S$.
  Thus $\SETpow(\SETunionover S) \in S$.
  Contradiction.
